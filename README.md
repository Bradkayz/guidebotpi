GuidebotPI
Overview
GuidebotPI is a companion app for the Pi Network ecosystem, designed to educate and connect Pioneers. Built by bradkayz, this web-based application features a chatbot to answer Pi-related questions, community tools for profile sharing and security circle formation, and resources like official channels, founder bios, verified businesses, and a blockchain explorer link. Styled in Pi’s signature purple (#6A1B9A) and yellow (#FFD700), it aims to enhance user engagement and support the Pi community, with potential for Testnet and Mainnet listing.
